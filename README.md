**Library Management System**


This project uses several key technologies. HTML is used to structure the web page, creating forms for users to interact with the system. PHP handles the server-side logic, managing form submissions and interacting with the MySQL database, which stores and retrieves book records. The project is developed in a local environment using WAMP.

The application offers several features. Users can add new books to the database by filling out a form, entering details such as the book title, author, ISBN, and available copies. The update feature allows users to modify existing book records, enabling changes to book details like title, author, and ISBN. The delete feature permits the removal of books from the database. Users can also view all available books through the list all books feature, which displays book records in a table format
